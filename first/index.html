  Leorio is a tall, manly-looking, fairly muscular young man with small brown eyes, black hair, and a spiked crew cut. He typically wears a dark blue business suit, black shoes, and a pair of tea shade sunglasses. Some of the characters such as Killua near at the beginning of the story mistake Leorio for an old man, but he is actually a lot younger than he looks, being a teenager at the start of the series.
